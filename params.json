We are tasked to design a simple toy microprocessor which includes: \r\n\r\n- An Assembler in C \r\n- Implementation through an FPGA\r\n\r\nwith architecture features including:\r\n- Two Level Cache\r\n- Two Issue SS\r\n- Floating Point Unit \r\n- Branch Prediction\r\nand more \r\n\r\nOur processor is based on a subset of the MIPS ISA, with support of the MIPS CoProc 1 subset support for floating point \r\n\r\n### Blog Updates\r\nCheck each of our individual branches to see our current updates and wiki changes, as well as worklogs\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nRonobir Das (@RonobirDas) and Jonathan Young (@littlecheldon) \r\n\r\n### Other important websites: \r\n* [UNLV IEEE website](http://unlvieee.me)\r\n\r\n* [General Digital Design Help](http://rebelsites.unlv.edu/~mookherj)\r\n","google":"UA-68563559-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
